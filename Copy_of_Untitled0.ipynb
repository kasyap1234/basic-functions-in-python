        "# \n",
        "# In this assignment, you'll get to practice some of the concepts and skills covered in the following notebooks:\n",
        "# \n",
        "# 1. [First Steps with Python and Jupyter](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/first-steps-with-python)\n",
        "# 2. [A Quick Tour of Variables and Data Types](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-variables-and-data-types)\n",

        "# As you go through this notebook, you will find the symbol **???** in certain places. To complete this assignment, you must replace all the **???** with appropriate values, expressions or statements to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end. \n",
        "# \n",
        "# **Guidelines**\n",
        "# \n",
        "# 1. Make sure to run all the code cells, otherwise you may get errors like `NameError` for undefined variables.\n",
        "# 2. Do not change variable names, delete cells or disturb other existing code. It may cause problems during evaluation.\n",
        "# 3. In some cases, you may need to add some code cells or new statements before or after the line of code containing the **???**. \n",
        "# 4. Since you'll be using a free online service for code execution, save your work by running `jovian.commit` at regular intervals.\n",
        "# 5. Questions marked **(Optional)** will not be considered for evaluation, and can be skipped. They are for your learning.\n",
        "# 6. If you are stuck, you can ask for help on the course forum. Post errors, ask for hints and help others, but **please don't share the full solution answer code** to give others a chance to write the code themselves.\n",
        "# 7. After submission your code will be tested with some hidden test cases. Make sure to test your code exhaustively to cover all edge cases.\n",

        "# **Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)**: Click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
        "# \n",
        "# \n",
        "# **Option 2: Running on your computer locally**: To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org) & [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/), download the notebook and install the required libraries. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
        "# \n",
        "# **Saving your work**: You can save a snapshot of the assignment to your [Jovian](https://jovian.ai) profile, so that you can access it later and continue your work. Keep saving your work by running `jovian.commit` from time to time.\n",
